Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing 
it is not allowed.

0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, ¡°this License¡± refers to version 1.0 of Leafing Library Public License.
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a 
Combined Work as defined below.
"The Original Author" refers to the author/team who created the project.
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is 
not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed 
a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

1. Basic Permissions
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are 
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited 
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by 
this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License 
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions 
so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for 
the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in 
conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the 
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on 
terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their 
relationship with you. 

2. Conveying Verbatim Copies
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright 
notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License apply to the code; keep intact all notices 
of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the 
Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support 
or warranty protection for a fee. 

3. Conveying Modified Versions
You may convey modified version of The Library.
But the following modification are NOT allowed:
    1. library title
    2. library description
    3. library company
    4. library product name
    5. library copyright
    6. library main version
    7. library file name
    8. etc of such infomation
If you modified the code of The Library and convey it, it means you waive the rights of your 
modified code and contribute it to The Original Author. And you need send a full copy of the 
modified code to The Original Author before you convey it.
Copy code from The Library to other project is NOT allowed.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER 
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY 
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
